# PokéFit

*A fusion of Pokémon TCG Pocket and Pokémon GO — turning real-world fitness into collectible fun!*

Inspired by *Pokémon GO*’s active lifestyle design and *TCG Pocket*’s digital card-opening excitement, PokéFit lets users earn points from their physical activity (like steps) and spend those points to open virtual Pokémon card packs.

## Goal & Purpose

The aim of PokéFit is to **motivate healthy habits through play**.
Instead of treating fitness as a chore, we reward users for real-world movement by giving them collectible digital Pokémon cards.
Every step contributes toward earning points, every point brings you closer to opening a new pack, and every pack adds to your growing collection.
